-------- TODO LIST --------

DEBUG INFO:
[] test
[] render adjacent indices relative to player position? OR
[] render all indices in the room and whether or not they are blocked
[] add a keypress that toggles debug information

BFS Level Search :
[] store room properties like the adjacent rooms, along with whether it is a boss room, treasure room, and if it contains
-- -- hearts or any other collectibles in it and then allow the goal to be finding an unvisited room or the boss room

[] if there are multiple unvisited doors then just go to the closest one

TEST CASES (SEEDS)
[X] N8ERWR90 (has unreachable pedestal item and mandatory button on first floor)

NAVIGATE:
[] if you can't get a pedestal item, then just move on
[] if a pedestal item spawns after you're already navigating to the door, re-navigate to that item
[] if the doors are already open, ignore the pressure plates
[] pick up items on floor
[] don't pick up item if it is a heart or battery you can't consume
[] issue with BOSS RUSH, tries to leave room after picking up item
[] ROOM NAVIGATION RANKING
  [] go into angel rooms and devil rooms
  [] go into unvisited treasure rooms
  [] go into boss rooms

[] don't consider the following as enemies to attack
  [] spike blocks
  [] statues (STONEHEAD) [42.0.0]
  [] (DEATHS_HEAD)
  [] the doors in the mom room are always considered enemies


aStar Room Search :
[] add cost for spider webs, chests, etc.
[] also we need to let isaac know that he can break POOP and FIRE tiles if he wants to get through them
[] also we need to special case the on and off spikes, since isaac needs to go over them in some cases when they are off
[] TODO nextValidGridIndices needs to be updated to deal with diagonal movement blocking cases
[] TODO increase cost of moving diagonally in aStarRoomSearch (maybe just bring back smoothing?)
[] TODO he kinda just walks into the pedestal forever if his starting position was on the pedestal
[] if you're flying, change the search to rage through objects
[] IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE PEDESTAL ITEMS AND ONE IS BLOCKED, CHOOSE THE OTHER
